# Amazon-Clone-Website
An Amazon Clone website is a simple e-commerce web page designed using HTML and CSS to mimic Amazonâ€™s layout and design. It includes key sections like a header with a logo, search bar, and navigation menu, a homepage with product listings, and a footer with links and information.

Using HTML, I structured the webpage with divs, sections, and lists to organize the content. CSS was used to style the elements, including fonts, colors, and layouts to make the site visually appealing. Flexbox and Grid helped create a responsive design, ensuring the website looked good on different screen sizes.

Basic hover effects and buttons were added using CSS to improve user interaction. Although this clone is static (without real functionality like payments), it provides a foundation for a professional-looking e-commerce site.
